## Description
## What this project does?
-- This project takes the parameters of an used car like: Company name, Model name, Year of Purchase, Fuel Type and Number of Kilometers it has been driven.
-- It then predicts the possible price of the car. For example, the image below shows the predicted price of our Hyundai Grand i10.

## How this project does?

-- First of all the data was scraped from Quikr.com (https://quikr.com) Link for data: -- https://github.com/rajtilakls2510/car_price_predictor/blob/master/quikr_car.csv

-- The data was cleaned (it was super unclean :( ) and analysed.

-- Then a Linear Regression model was built on top of it which had 0.92 R2_score.
-- This project was given the form of an website built on Flask where we used the Linear Regression model to perform predictions.

## Project Aim.
- This project aims to predict the Price of an used Car by taking it's Company name, it's Model name, Year of Purchase, and other parameters.
